
My Python Scripts

### What is this repository for? ###

* All the python scripts I created during my work. Most of them Are used as an alternative to shell
  scripts on function such as backing up files.


### How do I get set up? ###

* As long as you have python 3 installed you'll be fine. Most of the scripts are written in python 3.


### Contribution guidelines ###

* If you have problem running them by ./SCRIPT_NAME, try python SCRIPT_NAME. Most likely you don't have
  permission to execute the file, try 'chmod u+x SCRIPT_NAME'. Otherwise you don't have the corresponding
  sh program on the path given at first line of the script, like '#!/usr/bin/zsh'.
